### Perudo Rules

Below are the essential rules of Perudo, written in a format suitable for creating a simulation:

---

### 1. **Game Setup**
- Each player starts with **5 dice**.
- Dice are rolled in secret so only the player can see their own dice.

---

### 2. **Gameplay Mechanics**
#### a. **Rounds**:
1. Players take turns **bidding** on the number of dice showing a specific face value across all players' hidden dice.
   - Example: "Four 3s" means at least four dice show a 3 across all players.
2. Bids must increase either:
   - The **quantity** (e.g., "Five 3s").
   - The **value** of the dice face (e.g., "Four 4s").
   - Or both.
   - Optionally the quantity can be halfed and called for ones. If transitioning back to a non 1 number the bid must be more than doubled.

3. Ones ("1s") are **wild**:
   - They count as any number the bidder specifies.

#### b. **Challenges**:
1. A player can challenge the previous bid by calling **"Dudo"** (Spanish for "I doubt").
   - This stops bidding for the round.

2. Once "Dudo" is called:
   - All players reveal their dice.
   - Count the total dice matching the value in the latest bid (including wild "1s").

#### c. **Outcomes**:
- **Bid is correct**: The challenger loses 1 die.
- **Bid is incorrect**: The bidder loses 1 die.

### 3. **Special Rules**
#### a. **Exact Bids (Calza)**:
- A player can call **"Calza"** (meaning "exact") if they believe the previous bid is exactly correct.
  - If correct: The player who called "Calza" gains a dice
  - If incorrect: The player who called "Calza" loses 1 die.

#### b. **Elimination**:
- A player is eliminated when they lose all their dice.

---

### 4. **Endgame**
- The game continues until one player remains with dice, who is declared the winner.
